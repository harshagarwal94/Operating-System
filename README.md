### memory Allocation Problem 

Consider six memory partitions of size 200 KB, 400 KB, 600 KB, 500 KB,
300 KB and 250 KB. These partitions need to be allocated to four
processes of sizes 357 KB, 210 KB, 468 KB and 491 KB in that order.
Perform the allocation of processes using-
First Fit Algorithm.
Best Fit Algorithm.
Worst Fit Algorithm.
Compare Which algorithms make the most efficient use of memory.
